"""Write a function slopeOfLine that first asks the user for four values y1, y1, x2 and
y2 that represent two points in two-dimensional space (i.e. points with coordinates
(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)). The function should then output the slope of the line that connects
them. (Hint: copy the relevant expression from the shell â€” see the warm-up exercises!)"""
